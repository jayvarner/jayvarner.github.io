I am a software engineer in Atlanta. I love developing new ways to display and interact with old material. I’m currently working on a master’s degree in information architecture with a concentration in user experience design at Kent State University. I’ll be blogging here for my classes. I will also be blogging about my work using [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and various web mapping adventures. Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jayvarner) if you have any questions.
