ReminderX had a great and simple to-do mobile app. It had hit a plateau with user adoption. ReminderX needed to expand its features without ruining the simplicity that the current users enjoyed.

            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <p>
              My initial research revealed that moms with children younger than three are underserved by current to-do management apps. Designing features for this group's complex, evolving needs will ultimately produce features that help broader populations, as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I talked to moms with varying employment and relationship statuses. We talked about how they try to manage everything. So with my mind blown, I sat down and focused on two salient themes; syncing with other shared calendars and the ability to delegate to-dos.  Preliminary workflows and wireframes were produced to give the ReminderX team an opportunity to give feedback and to guide discussion about the direction moving forward.

            <h3>Integrate</h3>
            <p>
            Of course, nobody wants to enter the same to-do in multiple places, but when it comes to working moms, there are a lot of niche specialties Reminder X doesnâ€™t need to try to dominate: pumping schedules, sleep training schedules, a!er-school activity schedules, Outlook calendars etc.

            <h3>Delegate</h3>
            <p>
              Not only is covering all the bases too much for one person, so is knowing the bases that need coverage. A parent must be able to delegate to-dos and remind a partner, caretaker or child of what needs to get done.

            <h2>The Evaluations</h2>
            <p>
              After presenting my results to the project team at ReminderX, I took their feedback and mocked up a prototype. I then put that prototype in front of some moms and recorded their attempts to navigate the prototype. They showed me many things I got wrong. As painful as it was, I was so grateful to take that feedback and improve the designs.


              <!-- put pencil to paper. I produced a prototype based on our discussions and put them in front of users to see what did work, and more importantly, what did not. After the user testing, I provided recordings of the testing sessions, and analysis of what worked and what did not. -->

            <h2>Producing the Final Design</h2>
            <p>
              I reviewed the recordings and notes from the user testing and keyed in on the struggles the testers had with the navigation and Icon choices. Originally, I used <i class="material-icons">sync</i> to indicate syncing. This did not go over very well. I conferred with colleagues and in the final design used <i class="material-icons">share</i> to indicate sharing to an external calendar. The navigation was fixed by removing some ambiguity and adding icons and labels.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about user testing. Despite the fact that I was testing very discrete tasks; when people felt lost, they just started tapping things. I didn't have a screen for everything.

                The biggest design lesson was to label icons. I do not care anymore about space. Always label icons.
