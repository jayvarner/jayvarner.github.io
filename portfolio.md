ReminderX had a great and simple to-do mobile app. They had hit a plateau with user adoption. ReminderX needed to expand its features without ruining the simplicity...and some other flowery language.

            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <p>
              My initial research revealed that moms with children younger than three are underserved by current to-do management apps. Designing features for this group's complex, evolving needs will ultimately produce features that help broader populations, as well.

            <p>
              Preliminary workflows and wireframes were produced to give the ReminderX team an opportunity to give feedback and to guide discussion of the direction moving forward.

            <h2>The Evaluations</h2>
            <p>
                I produced a prototype based on our discussions and put them in front of users to see what did, and more importantly, what did not work. A!er the user testing, I provided recordings of the testing session, and analysis of what went well and what did not.

            <h2>How I Fixed it All</h2>
            <p>
                The user testing revealed that there were deficiencies in navigation and recognizing icons. The revised designs address the issues that were revealed. Below are updated workflows, and a set of screens with the revised design. For reference, I have also included a set of the screens we used for testing, as well as links to the recordings of the user testing.
