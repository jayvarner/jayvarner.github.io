ReminderX had a great and simple to-do mobile app. It had hit a plateau with user adoption. ReminderX needed to expand its features without ruining the simplicity that the current users enjoyed.

            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <p>
              My initial research revealed that moms with children younger than three are underserved by current to-do management apps. Designing features for this group's complex, evolving needs will ultimately produce features that help broader populations, as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I talked to moms with varying employment and relationship statuses. We talked about how they try to manage everything. So with my mind blown, I sat down and focused on two salient themes.  Preliminary workflows and wireframes were produced to give the ReminderX team an opportunity to give feedback and to guide discussion about the direction moving forward.

            <h3>Integrate</h3>
            <p>
            Of course, nobody wants to enter the same to-do in multiple places, but when it comes to working moms, there are a lot of niche specialties Reminder X doesnâ€™t need to try to dominate: pumping schedules, sleep training schedules, a!er-school activity schedules, Outlook calendars etc.

            <h3>Delegate</h3>
            <p>
              Not only is covering all the bases too much for one person, so is knowing the bases that need coverage. A parent must be able to delegate to-dos and remind a partner, caretaker or child of what needs to get done.

            <h2>The Evaluations</h2>
            <p>
              After presenting my results to the project team at ReminderX, I took their feedback and drew up a prototype. Then I put that prototype in front of some moms and recorded their attempts to navigate the prototype. They showed me many things I got wrong. As painful as it was, I was so grateful to take that feedback and improve the designs.


              <!-- put pencil to paper. I produced a prototype based on our discussions and put them in front of users to see what did work, and more importantly, what did not. After the user testing, I provided recordings of the testing sessions, and analysis of what worked and what did not. -->

            <h2>How I Fixed It All</h2>
            <p>
              I reviewed the recordings and notes from the user testing and keyed in on
                The user testing revealed that there were deficiencies in navigation and recognizing some icons. The revised designs address those issues. Below are updated workflows, and a set of screens with the revised design. For reference, I have also included a set of the screens we used for testing, as well as links to the recordings of the user testing.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about user testing. Despite the fact that I was testing very discrete tasks; when people felt lost, they just started tapping things. I didn't have a screen for everything.

                The biggest design lesson was to label icons. I do not care anymore about space. Always label icons.
