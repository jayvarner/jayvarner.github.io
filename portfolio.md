ReminderX had a great and simple to-do mobile app. It had hit a plateau with user adoption. ReminderX needed to expand its features without ruining the simplicity that the current users enjoyed.

            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <p>
              My initial research revealed that moms with children younger than three are underserved by current to-do management apps. Designing features for this group's complex, evolving needs will ultimately produce features that help broader populations, as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preliminary workflows and wireframes were produced to give the ReminderX team an opportunity to give feedback and to guide discussion about the direction moving forward.

            <h3>Integrate</h3>
            <p>
            Of course, nobody wants to enter the same to-do in multiple places, but when it comes to working moms, there are a lot of niche specialties Reminder X doesnâ€™t need to try to dominate: pumping schedules, sleep training schedules, a!er-school activity schedules, Outlook calendars etc.

            <h3>Delegate</h3>
            <p>
              Not only is covering all the bases too much for one person, so is knowing the bases that need coverage. A parent must be able to delegate to-dos and remind a partner, caretaker or child of what needs to get done.

            <h2>The Evaluations</h2>
            <p>
              After presenting my results to the project team at ReminderX, I took their feedback and put pencil to paper.
                I produced a prototype based on our discussions and put them in front of users to see what did work, and more importantly, what did not. After the user testing, I provided recordings of the testing sessions, and analysis of what worked and what did not.

            <h2>How I Fixed It All</h2>
            <p>
                The user testing revealed that there were deficiencies in navigation and recognizing some icons. The revised designs address those issues. Below are updated workflows, and a set of screens with the revised design. For reference, I have also included a set of the screens we used for testing, as well as links to the recordings of the user testing.
