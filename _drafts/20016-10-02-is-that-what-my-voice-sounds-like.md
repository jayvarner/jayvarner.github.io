I have tested with users before. It has always come naturally to me. I had a really hard time with testing papajohns.com for this week's assignment. This assignment took me a few tries. I love that I have friends who were willing to help. Here are the handful of reasons I think it was such a slog for me.

1) The first session I did; I was just tired. I had no business conducting a user test at that time. I was totally flat. I knew this, but I had someone lined up and just went ahead. Presumably, in real life, I would not schedule a session late on a Friday night. Now I really know to not do that.

2) I have moderated this sort of test on many projects. Looking back at recordings for other projects, I always feel good about my approach and the results. I have have a long history interviewing people. I'm really comfortable prompting people to tell me stories. Surprising to me, I really tightened up during this assignment. I don't know if it was having a script, or knowing I was being graded on my performance.

3) Maybe I just couldn't get into it because I don't really care about Papa Johns. I have zero investment. I understand this is actually a good teaching example. As a UX professional, you might not always be working on something you care about. Nevertheless, you have to be professional and do your job.
