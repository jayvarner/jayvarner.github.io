I am done with my first semester as a grad student. I am really excited to move on and learn more.

In my first semester, I learned a lot. Aside from high school art classes[^art], I have never been exposed to any design theory. I am grateful for those art classes.

Since this is the last post for the semester, I'll just take a walk. When I first got into “web development”, there was no CSS and the cgi-bin was where you put everything that did anything interesting. I drifted away.

After college, I helped start a [non-profit bike shop](http://sopobikes.org/) (that website, not my work). I took charge of the website. I learned that this CSS thing happened and that, for a moment, the browser war was over. I was excited. I went about developing a CMS and catching up on all that had changed in web development. I read “Don’t Make Me Think” and it changed everything. I made [a site based on what that book taught me.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070811180020/http://www.sopobikes.org/). I parlayed that back and front end work into a series of jobs that eventually landed me in a senior software engineering job. In this current role, I have to do a lot of UXD.

The newer edition of “Don’t Make Me Think” is on the reading list for next semester. I’m excited to pick up there and develop an ability to create fantastic user experiences.

[^art]: Yup, I went to high school when there were art classes.
