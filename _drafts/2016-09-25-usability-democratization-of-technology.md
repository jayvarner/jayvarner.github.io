*The new technologies represent a transition towards the new forms of society based on creation and information/knowledge exchange. The continuous changes leave their marks not only upon human-computer interaction, but also upon the human behavior, upon the collective consciousness and upon the social-economic environment. The development of information society contributes to increasing the likelihood of confronting with accessibility problems. And there is more to it than meets the eye: the social and cultural infrastructure that acts as a support to the socio-economic environment can no longer measure up to the new aspects of knowledge society.*[^article]

I found this article while researching facial expressions during usability testing. It talks about that, but the above quote really poked me. Honestly, everything I have to say about this cannot fit in my allotted three paragraphs. In general, what I really started thinking about is that usability should always imply accessibility. The interesting bit that Cristescu pushes is the that economic accessibility should be included.

Technology has already begun to democratize areas like publishing and music distribution. The examples of the Arab Spring and BlackLivesMatter show the ability of people to connect across geographies and organize around their shared experiences. By making tools usable and accessible, user experience designers are essentially working to democratize everything they touch. That's a solid reason to get out of bed.

But the economic barrier is daunting. It requires a lot of changes. There is still a digital divide and access to these tools are still limited to those with resources. How can usability designers help? It is a worthwhile challenge and something I want to develop more in my studies. Like I said, these blog posts assignments don't give me enough room to flush this out.
