User testing is always painful. I know what to expect. It will never not be demoralizing to watch a user struggle with my design.

So that picture above is the pained and dejected look on my face while watching someone test my designs. There’s the old joke “this would be easy if it weren’t for the users.” It would also be really boring if it weren’t for the users.

The joy of designing and developing software is the hope that someone else will find it useful and usable. I really thought that icon I drew screamed *sync*. Everyone else thought it said *recur*. I have to let that go. It’s not about me. It’s about the user.

All that said, watching video of users testing my designs was painful and reminds me of this Simpsons clip.
