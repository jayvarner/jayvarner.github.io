Designing software is basically designing a “choose your own adventure” game. Using software is often an adventure. User experience designers need to remember that the protagonist in the adventure is the user.

This is important to keep in mind when doing usability testing. It seems there is an industry standard in usability testing that the facilitator follow a script. As a developer, who has to go through the feature acceptance process, I know well that people will find fascinating ways to (mis)use software. The designers will say the flow is based on usability testing. But still, the actual product owner will click on the craziest thing to complete a task. How was that missed in testing? Maybe the tests were bad?

In my reading this week on conducting usability tests, the idea of a script really bothered me. I once had a job where, daily, I interviewed many people.[^mit] The best results came from interviews where I just started a conversation. I had goals of covering specific areas. I would only ask direct questions if those topics did not come up. Even then, I try to nudge the conversation before resorting to direct questions. I found it best to just start a conversation and passively follow the interviewee. They would often take me down roads I never thought of. This experience and approach seems like a perfect way to conduct usability testing. This is why I didn’t write a script for my tests. I plan to have a conversation about each feature. There are specific bits I want to cover, but I’m not going to force that until the end. I guess we’ll see how it works out.
