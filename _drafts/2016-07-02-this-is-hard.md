Design is hard. It is something I have to do. I do not do it well. That's why I'm pursuing a master's in UX design. My hand writing is awful. I can't draw a dog that my two-year-old will recognize as a dog. I know when I like a color combo, but I can't tell you why. Please don't ask me to pick out colors. Picking colors gives me great anxiety. So I've spent the last few week confronting those anxieties. It's been hard.

The hard times run the gamut. Last week I had to layout a type system specimen. I used HTML and CSS to lay it out. That's what I know. That should work right? Nope, doesn't work well when you need to turn in a PDF. This week I tried a tool, Sketch, for layout. It's pretty easy program to use. However, I had similar problems exporting for print. I've heard designers like Adobe Illustrator. So I downloaded a trail of that and fumbled my way though. I'm sure my actual work product would've been better had I not spent so much time trying to learn how to layout grids in software that is foreign and complex.

I remain excited, despite all the struggles I've had through this first class. When I introduced myself to my classmates; I said I was here to do better. I'm getting better. I've already put some lessons to work on my team. To use a tired cliche, I must keep reminding myself that this is a marathon, not a sprint.
