My weekly reminder of “bounce this idea of someone else” came from my UXD course work. I submitted some draft wireframes for feedback from my peers. I’m really glad that was part of the assignment.

A classmate mentioned that I had put my navigation along the top. Her point was that, in a mobile apps, [a common ](https://uxplanet.org/perfect-bottom-navigation-for-mobile-app-effabbb98c0f) [best practice](https://uxplanet.org/mobile-design-best-practices-2d16d37ecfe) [is to](http://blog.usabilla.com/designing-thumbs-thumb-zone/) [place the main navigation](https://medium.com/tall-west/lets-ditch-the-nav-bar-3692cb17cc67) [in the](http://gizmodo.com/how-to-design-for-thumbs-in-the-era-of-huge-screens-1636955848) [*thumb zone*](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/): the area of the screen that is easy to reach with your thumb while holding a mobile device.

At first, I dismissed the feedback. Personally, I don’t really use my thumbs for navigating on my phone. I was also positive I had read a really great argument against thumb zone navigation.

The feedback nagged at me. I searched for that argument. Everything I found talked about the virtues of designing for the thumb-zone. So, my revised wireframes have the main navigation in the thumb-zone.

Thanks classmate!
