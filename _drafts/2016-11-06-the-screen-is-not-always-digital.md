Wherever you fall on the ideology spectrum, I think it is safe to say no one finds interacting with government, local to national, pleasant. The thought of interacting with any level of government conjures up visions of long lines and confusing forms.

[This article](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3065107/slicker-city/how-one-florida-city-is-reinventing-itself-with-ux-design) about how Gainesville, Florida is applying the lessons of human-centered designed to bureaucracy is somewhere between inspiring and interesting.

> But upon talking to more Gainesville citizens, the group learned that what they really wanted was a guide—someone to lead them through the often-confusing process.[^fluxd]

It is inspiring because it shows that UXD is relevant [beyond screens](http://www.npr.org/2016/11/06/500678100/the-art-of-the-vote-who-designs-the-ballots-we-cast) and [doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI).

It is only interesting in that, in reality, Gainesville's “[Department of Doing](http://www.gainesville.com/news/20161004/dept-of-doing-explains-what-it-does)”, an organization dedicated to facilitating the steps needed to start a business[^dod], is essentially a front-end interface for a very messy API.

> The goal is not to get a permit; it’s to open a business.[^fluxd]

My concern is opening a business is the Department of Doing’s focus. It would have a better impact if “The goal is not to grant a property tax expansion; it’s to keep people in their homes.”

Regardless, the fact that a city is taking a human-centered approach to bureaucracy is something to follow.
