We don’t need to ask people questions when it is totally reasonable for the system to already have the information.

In my interaction design class, I’ve been building a prototype of an app for parents or guardians to:

- See what their kid’s school is serving for lunch
- Manage account balances and payment methods for school lunches

The specs stated that the parent or guardian would be provided with an access code to set up their account in the app.

While evaluating classmate’s prototypes, I noticed a lot of interactions around adding a child to an account. My thinking is that initial access code is tied to a family. School administrators would add any new kid to a family and would just show up in anyone’s account tied to that family. It is like when you open up a savings account at the bank where you have a checking account. The new account just shows up (or it should) when sign in to online banking. No need to manually add it.
