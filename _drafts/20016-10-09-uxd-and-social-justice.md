*‘[D]ifferences in user experiences are driving people to make bad choices.'* - Sumana Harihareswara, Code4Lib 2014[^c4l]

[^c4l]: [http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10482](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10482)


In her 2014 [keynote at Code4Lib](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10482), Sumana Harihareswara, among other things, argues that the success of products like [Keurig](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/the-abominable-k-cup-coffee-pod-environment-problem/386501/) and [payday loans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDylgzybWAw) are successful over more traditional brewing techniques or bank services because they provide a better user experience. So if user experience design can be used to enable bad decisions, the reverse must be true.

I have been thinking a lot more about the intersection between UXD and social justice. Both are rooted in empathy. Empathy is at the heart of human centered design. It is all about making the lives of people better. One cannot understand the need for social justice without having empathy for the people’s experiences that are different from your own’s.

As with all things though, there is a question of privilege and access. It is great to have your design of a water filter recognized as the greatest thing ever. It is awful if the design did not account for people actually being able to afford one. (This has also led me to think more about “accessible first” design, rather than “mobile first”...that’s a different post.)

Though defunct now, [Architecture for Humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_for_Humanity) is a great example of how designers can use their skills to increase access to shelter. Or the [Empowerment Plan](http://www.empowermentplan.org/about), that started as a design school project to create a coat for homeless people that doubles as a sleeping bag. It was such as success that it is now a full blown non-profit that employees homeless people to manufacture the coats.

PS. This post has been a struggle. I keep going off on tangents. I’m a software engineer who majored in political theory and minored in sociology and history. At some point, I hope I have the opportunity to really dig in and write a coherent piece about how UXD has a role in fixing our current shit show.
