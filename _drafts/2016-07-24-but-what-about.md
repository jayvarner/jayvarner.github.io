Errors. Error happen in software. As a developer I have think of all the ways something can fail and design way to handle it gracefully. I am sort of obsessed with it. This week’s assignment was to lay out a flow chart and wireframes for new features in our to-app. My biggest struggle was to keep it “high level”. “High level” seems to mean incomplete.

I get it, to draw all the cases where errors can occur would get pretty messy and stakeholders might not want to think about a person getting errors while using the app. I have spent so much time coming up with all sorts of edge cases for an app that I some point I just had to stop.

This initial phase of design would be a great time to start noting and designing for what failures could and will occur. If some things are identified early on, the systems team can begin research, testing, and building the infrastructure ahead of time. The developers can research strategies for This give the rollout of the features a better chance at success. Developers can start researching strategies to implement more complex features. Doing so will produce a more complete design that will make development and rollout a smoother process.
