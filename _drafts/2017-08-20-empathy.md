“This would easy if it weren’t for the users.” --Common joke among software engineers

It’s funny because it’s true. Building software would be really easy if no one ever used it. Obviously, it would be as easy as it would be pointless.

Over the past few weeks, for my interaction design class, I’ve been building a prototype of an app that gives caregivers of school children the ability to manage a child’s funds for school lunch. The first two weeks of the course had us really focus on personas as we developed journey maps and a site map.

While thinking about the app’s hierarchy, it was really helpful to think about Henry -- the 70 year old retiree with minimal exposure to technology -- who is taking care of his grandson. But as the project went along, it was easy to forget about Henry and revert back to my thinking from my own perspective. In future projects, I plan on making a space to hang the personas on the wall so I will have to look at them everyday.
