This post from Cliff Kuang *[Trump Exposes a Fatal Flaw in User-Friendly Design](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3065565/what-responsibility-does-design-bear-for-the-trump-era)* really struck me. I read [the articles](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/donald-trump-won-because-of-facebook.html) [blaming](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/14/how-to-watch-the-world-burn-and-do-nothing/) [FaceBook](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/11/11/we_can_t_know_whether_facebook_is_to_blame_for_trump_s_win.html) for the election of Trump. And I totally see the argument. My own FaceBook feed is quite the echo chamber. But it's not my news source. The thing that really struck me about this article was

I've often looked at UXD as a democratizing force. I mean, the goal is to make technology and information accessible to more people. Turns out accessible is only the start; and not all information is created equal. We need to figure out how make facts more accessible. That's a big a tricky task. I'm only getting started on this.
