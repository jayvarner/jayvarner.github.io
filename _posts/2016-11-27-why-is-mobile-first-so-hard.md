*Oh. So it is... and it isn't.*
-- Coop *Wet Hot American Summer* **

The readings for the past two weeks on mobile testing really made me look at the responsiveness of my current projects. I'm aware of the best practices. At best, I'm doing a pretty mediocre job. I know better. So why mediocre?

No one in "charge" is checking? Responsive design isn't factored into the feature's estimation? I'm lazy?

Those are indefensible reasons.


\* More importantly, I want to study more about making stuff accessible. We should really be talking about accessible first. I need to do better.
