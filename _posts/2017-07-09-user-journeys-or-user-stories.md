For the years, I have been working in an agile setting where product owners write user stories, I deliver the story, and the product owner accepts or rejects the story. A user story is meant to be the smallest, testable functionality. They are written in the format of "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"[^userstory]

[^userstory]:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format)
user stories are macro -  the smallest interaction
journies are micro
