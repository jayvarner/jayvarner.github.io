For years, I have been working in an agile setting where product owners write user stories, I deliver the story, and the product owner accepts or rejects the story. They are written in the format of

```As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>``` [^userstory]

When written correctly, a user story describes the smallest, testable functionality. For example:

```As a waffle cook, I want to hear a series of beeps when the waffle iron is ready so I know I'm good to fill it with batter.```

In my UXD master's program, I spent the last week working with `user journeys`.

In that week, I've gone back-and-forth while comparing the two. It comes down to a classic macro vs. micro debate. As a developer, I'm comfortable with user stories.

[^userstory]:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format)
user stories are macro -  the smallest interaction
journies are micro
