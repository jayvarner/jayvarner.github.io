For years, I have been working in an agile setting. The product owners write user stories, I deliver the story, and the product owner accepts or rejects the story.

Use stories, on a micro scale, describe a testable action and are written in the format of

```As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>``` [^userstory]

When written correctly, a user story describes the smallest, testable functionality. For example:

```As the Dude - I want my rug back - because it really tied the room together.```

In my UXD master's program, I spent the last week working with `user journeys`.

I've been going back-and-forth while comparing the two. It comes down to a classic macro vs. micro debate. As a developer, I'm comfortable with user stories. However, writing user stories is a skill. User stories often do not describe the whole story, or parts of the the story are "implied."

For example, I recently had a story

```As a user, I want to create an account so I can save my work.```
