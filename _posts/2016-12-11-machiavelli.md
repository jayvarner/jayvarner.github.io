“Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception.”
― Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince

OK, maybe this is a little over the top, but reading *[Selling Usability](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Usability-Experience-Infiltration-Tactics/dp/1442103736)* by John Rhodes felt gross. I understand that we are learning about an industry here. However, I get a little cranky when text like this creep in.

I want to learn how to make useful things easy and accessible though research informed design. I'd get an MBA if I wanted to learn how to play people.

It's the end of the semester, it got cold, and I'm felling a bit punchy. But seriously, my takeaways from *Selling Usability* were:
* Don’t speak in UX terms
* Couch everything in MBA speak
* If you say anything, it better be about improving the bottom line
