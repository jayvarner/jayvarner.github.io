*The new technologies represent a transition towards the new forms of society based on creation and information/knowledge exchange. The continuous changes leave their marks not only upon human-computer interaction, but also upon the human behavior, upon the collective consciousness and upon the social-economic environment. The development of information society contributes to increasing the likelihood of confronting with accessibility problems. And there is more to it than meets the eye: the social and cultural infrastructure that acts as a support to the socio-economic environment can no longer measure up to the new aspects of knowledge society.*[^article]

I found this article while searching for an article about reading facial expressions during usability testing. And yeah, it talks about that, but the above quote really poked me. Honestly, everything I have to say about this cannot fit in my allotted three paragraphs. So I'll just say this: usability should always imply accessibility. The interesting bit that Cristescu pushes is the that economic accessibility should also be considered.

By making something usable and accessible, user experience designers are democratizing all these things. That's a solid reason to get out of bed. But the economic barrier is daunting. It requires a lot of changes. Like I said, these blog posts assignments don't give me enough room to flush this out. I will end with this quote from last's week's reading that stands in sharp contrast to this post's opening quote. The quote is justifying a screener question to preference people with high incomes.

>The income requirement will help participants stay away from focusing on
cost (the more affluent seem able to pay better attention to what they really
needâ€”or want).[^jerks]
