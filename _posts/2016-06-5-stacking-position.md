This week’s class assignment was to do a “tiny” critique and redesign of a dialogue box. When I first looked at the assignment, the obvious thing was pare down the options and reword some stuff. Somehow, I became fixated on the action buttons.

So I went down quite the rabbit hole. It was fun. There is the post [OK-Cancel or Cancel-OK?](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ok-cancel-or-cancel-ok/) from Jakob Nielsen where he concludes that the positive/primary action should go on the left because that’s how Windows does it and lots people use Windows. [An article](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/why-ok-buttons-in-dialog-boxes-work-best-on-the-right/) that I added to my [UX Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/jaysvarner/ux-resources/) takes direct aim at Nielsen’s argument by stressing that designers need to question convention and recognize when it is harmful. All the while, I read Nielsen’s partner, Don Norman, argue against being content with convention; Norman, in fact, uses a dialogue box from the Mac version of MS Word that shows the primary action button on the right. It’s an example that bucks his partner’s claim.

What I really find exciting here is that UXD is a living discipline with legitimate debates between smart people. I mean, I knew it was, but the cursory seeking of UXD advice on the Internet makes it seem like discussing opinions on something like primary action button placement is as useful as discussing [how a dog would wear pants](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ymczp/only_baffling_question_ive_ever_come_across_on/).
