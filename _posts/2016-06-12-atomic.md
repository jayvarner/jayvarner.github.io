So I’m a software developer working on a master’s in [information architecture/user experience design](https://www.kent.edu/slis/uxd). This has made me acutely aware of differences in approaches taken by developers and designers. This week, my assignment was to design a workflow, in flowchart form. My flowchart looked like a hot mess:

Through this assignment, and feedback from previous assignments, I realized that I’m approaching everything from the perspective of a developer. There were two bullet points of goals for the application described in the assignment. I took those two bullet points and turned them into fifteen [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).

I’m realizing that designers take on challenges with a goal oriented view. Developers are trained to engineer the discrete tasks to reach that goal. The designer’s approach is holistic where the developer’s is atomic.
