<!-- I made my first website in 1996. I was in high school. The site was about the Beats. Thanks GeoCities for letting a 16-year-old kid in rural Georgia make a (terrible) website about the Beats. In 2006 (according to my Amazon order History), I first read “Don’t Make Me Think.” I’m not exaggerating in saying that it changed my life. Here I am, in 2016, reading a revised DMMT for a master’s course in user experience design.

A lot of other stuff happened in those twenty years, but it all led to my current position as leader on a software engineering team at an university. In this role, I am the tech lead -->
According to my Amazon order history, I first read the second edition of Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" pretty much exactly ten years ago. Reading it changed the way I thought about how I thought about web design. It would not be an exaggerating to say it changed the course my life took.

One addition in "Don't Make Me Think! Revisited" is a section on how often to test. In short, Krug suggests that you should perform user testing once a month with three users. This is a brilliant idea. My team needs to be doing this. For starters, this fits in really well with the agile process. Furthermore, we work in a university library. We have easy access to a diverse and dynamic pool of a few thousand potential testers made up of undergrads, grad students, faculty, and staff.

This would vastly improve our current process of the lead engineer doing the best she or he can with some feedback from team members and product owners.
