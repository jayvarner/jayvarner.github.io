Eye tracking seems to be a bit much for general usability tests. The equipment is very specialized and expensive. The level of training needed to craft and evaluate tasks is great. In my opinion, it is sufficient to apply the lessons from published research and save the resources for more iterative testing.

Furthermore, results of eye tracking tests can be hard to interpret. One needs to be aware of the [Hawthorne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect) and the [the ketchup bottle problem](http://uxmag.com/articles/eye-tracking-and-web-usability-a-good-fit). The cost of misinterpreting the results would be astronomical. The studies done by the Nielsen Norman Group layout some design guidelines and best practices. Following these and testing often, in my opinion, is a better use of resources.
