# I Don't Like Serifs
I have never liked serifs. They are clunky. I find them to be a holdover from some gaudy past that should never be brought back. Vinyl is worth holding on to. Streetcars are worth bringing back. But serifs, they just have to go. I find beauty in clean, geometric lines. So I had a hard time in this week’s adventures in grad school.

I had to make a type system. I’ll be implementing it on this blog as soon as I have time. My system uses [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather), not [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans), as its primary body text.

I was really reluctant to use a serif font. I got really caught up with trying to find a sans font that scaled and made it easy to tell an uppercase “I” from a lowercase “l”. See, even my current style screws this up.
