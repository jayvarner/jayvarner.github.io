# I Don't Like Serifs
I never had. I find them clunky. I find them to be a holdover from some gaudy past that should never be brought back. Vinyl is worth holding on to. Streetcars are worth bringing back. But serifs, they just have to go.

In this week’s adventures in grad school, I realized we can’t totally move on...yet. I had to make a type system. I’ll be implementing it on this blog as soon as I have time. My system uses [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=Merriweather&selection.family=Merriweather+Sans:300,400|Open+Sans+Condensed:300i|Source+Sans+Pro|Work+Sans), not [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans?query=Merriweather&selection.family=Merriweather+Sans:300,400|Open+Sans+Condensed:300i|Source+Sans+Pro|Work+Sans), as it’s primary body text.
