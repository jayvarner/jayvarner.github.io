It is tempting to take advantage of tools [MTurk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) for testing. However, I am concerned that this system makes it to easy for researchers to exploit people by not paying a decent wage. (This post)[https://fakecrow.com/rapid-user-testing/] says it rather clear: "We don’t want to spend $10 or more per user like some of these services charge, or even $50 – 100 or more per month."

Even more bluntly, Vanessa Williamson from the Brookings Institute (wrote)[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2016/02/03/can-crowdsourcing-be-ethical-2/] "In the course of my graduate work at Harvard University, I paid hundreds of Americans living in poverty the equivalent of about $2 an hour." It seems really easy to forget the people picking up the tasks are, in fact, people. Some (point out)[https://www.viget.com/articles/how-to-run-quick-and-cheap-usability-tests-using-mechanical-turk] that the more you pay, the better your results will be. MTurk has the potential to be are really great tool for quick iterative tests. Just don't be a jerk and pay someone poverty level wages while you're collecting your salary or consulting fee.
