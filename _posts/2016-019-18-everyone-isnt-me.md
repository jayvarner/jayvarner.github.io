This week I wrote a really thorough scenario about all the pitfalls to ordering pizzas for a group. I had to totally trash it. The scenario I wrote was way too specific to me. My family unit is vegetarian. My mother-in-law is vegan. I have an omnivore and gluten free sister-in-law who is married to guy who will not eat anything unless bacon is involved. Then there are my very southern parents who are always, but not really, "fine with whatever".

At first, this seemed like a rich minefield for usability testing. There were countless curveballs to throw. "Oh, have you placed the order yet? Can you add bacon to everything?". It seemed great, but it was not relatable[^if]. This concept was missing from the assigned literature. You can come up with a great testing scenario, but it is worthless if the test participants cannot relate.
