This week I wrote a really thorough scenario about all the pitfalls of ordering pizzas for a group. I had to totally trash it. The scenario I wrote was way too specific to me. My family unit is vegetarian. My mother-in-law is vegan. I have an omnivore and gluten free sister-in-law who is married to guy who will not eat anything unless bacon is involved. Then there are my very southern parents who are always, but not really, "fine with whatever".

At first, this seemed like a rich minefield for usability testing. There were countless curveballs to throw. "Oh, have you placed the order yet? Can you add bacon to everything?". It seemed great, but it was not relatable. I could see much of this session being spent explaining the difference between vegan and vegetarian and that people who are gluten free can still eat meat.

I'm learning that being able to view things from outside yourself is important to every phase of experience design. It seems really easy for my own bias influence what I see as the problem. If I do that, I'm going to run the wrong test. Then I'll design amazing solutions to the wrong problem. Then I'll have wasted a lot of time.
