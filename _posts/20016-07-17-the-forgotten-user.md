My assignment this week boiled down to interviewing folks about how they manage to-dos. Early on I decided to focus my interviews on new(ish) moms. New parents in general suddenly have many new tasks shoved onto their plates. A 2015
[Pew Research Center report on work-life balance](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/11/04/raising-kids-and-running-a-household-how-working-parents-share-the-load/) that found a stark contrast in how respondents’ view their workloads. In homes where both parents work full-time, 54% said mom does more managing of children’s schedules and activities; 6% said dad does more. Thirty-one percent of respondents said mom does more handling of household chores and responsibilities; 9% said dad  
more. The imbalance is even greater when mom works part-time or is not employed.

So I interviewed four moms. There was a mom who works full-time in an office. A mom who works remotely. A mom who works and her partner stays at home. I started writing up my findings. It was then I realized that I left out single moms. I quickly interviewed two who happen to be close friends. So I clearly know single moms. How did I overlook a group that could potentially benefit the most from an easy to-do manager?

The answer is actually pretty simple and is discussed in UX literature. I was not raised by a single parent. My spouse and I are raising our daughter together. The lesson here is a great one both in my development as UX professional and as a human.
