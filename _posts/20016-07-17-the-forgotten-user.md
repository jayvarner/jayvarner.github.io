Struggles
Demanding home and work schedules
Trusting others to come through

Current
Outlook calendar for work
Google calendar for home
Chalkboard at home
Frantic emails and text messages

Time sucks
Meal planning
Arranging childcare
Arranging transportation
Coordinating kids’ supplies

Concerns
Reliability of mobile devices
Partner’s willingness to adopt
Changing systems
Privacy with web applications

Delegates
Brother-in-law
Parents
Regular babysitter
