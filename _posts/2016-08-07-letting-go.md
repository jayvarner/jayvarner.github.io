User testing is painful. I've done it before. I know what to expect. It’s still painful. It’s just demoralizing to watch a user struggle with your design and be reminded of watching a parent try to insert a picture into a Word document.

So that picture above is the pained and dejected look on my face while watching a someone test one of my designs.
