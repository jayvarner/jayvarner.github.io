User testing is painful. I've done it before. I know what to expect. It’s still painful. It’s just demoralizing to watch a user struggle with your design and be reminded of watching a parent try to insert a picture into a Word document.

So that picture above is the pained and dejected look on my face while watching a someone test one of my designs. There’s the old joke “this would be easy if it weren’t for the users.” It would also be really boring if it weren’t for the users.

The joy of designing and developing software is the hope that someone else will find it useful and usable. Sure, you think that icon you drew screams *sync*. You have to be okay with the fact that everyone else thinks it says *recur*. You have to let go. It’s not about you. It’s about the user.

All that said, watching video of users testing my designs was painful and reminds me of this Simpsons clip.
