This post from Cliff Kuang *[Trump Exposes a Fatal Flaw in User-Friendly Design](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3065565/what-responsibility-does-design-bear-for-the-trump-era)* really struck me. I read [the articles](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/donald-trump-won-because-of-facebook.html) [blaming](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/14/how-to-watch-the-world-burn-and-do-nothing/) [FaceBook](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/11/11/we_can_t_know_whether_facebook_is_to_blame_for_trump_s_win.html) for the election of Trump. And I totally see the argument. My own FaceBook feed is quite the echo chamber. But it's not my news source. The thing that really struck me about this article was
