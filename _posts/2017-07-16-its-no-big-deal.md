For the past two weeks in my UXD program, I've been working on an Lunch Money Buddy -- an app that let's parents/guardians manage paying for school lunch. We were given specs. One has really nagged at me.

> **View subsidy status:** If they participate in a school lunch subsidy program, the parent can view the status of their school lunch subsidy program account.

The first assignment was to crate [user journeys](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customer-journey-mapping/) for four of the features listed in the specs. Because social and economic justice are dear to me, I really wanted to rock this feature. I put a lot of work into it. Ultimately, I did not include it. The main reason was that my step-by-step for this was blank. I was not sure how well that would go over.

At this point, I should state that I am privileged. The extent of my knowledge of subsidized school lunch programs is that I am pretty sure they exist. I assume whatever exists is inadequate. So I looked up the [federal program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/applying-free-and-reduced-price-school-meals).[^sad]

In week two, I had to develop a site map for the app. I had to include this spec.

Aside from sending notifications regarding paperwork deadlines, I do not see any reason augment the person's interaction.

[^sad]:Though [the page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/applying-free-and-reduced-price-school-meals) seems to be back, I made a gif of when I tried to look it up last week. ![Sad](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iy2LprMhb8EEK3e/giphy.gif)
