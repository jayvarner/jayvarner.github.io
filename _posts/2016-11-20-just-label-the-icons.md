>What happens when you layer a science project on top of a walking tour on top of an art experiment on top of an archival map on top of demographic data on top of a memoir? What if the archives of multiple universities and other institutions could be accessed on one platform and layered with the projects, stories, and data from researchers, teachers, students, and community groups?

Many fantastic and unexpected things happen. One of the unexpected thing was that the engineer, me, wound up responsible for the design. And that led to me seeking a master's degree in user experience design. I often joke that "I have design opinions, but no design skills." I am not that far into my studies, but I already feel like I'm gaining some missing skills.

1. My design vocabulary has expanded. This makes it easier to ask questions and get answers.
2. I've been inspired by the work my classmates do.
3. I now have a supportive community where I can seek advice...and maybe even give some.

I really meant to talk about a post I read this week on [why you label icons](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/icons-as-part-of-a-great-user-experience/). I've read [plenty](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/) a  [posts](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/15744/do-icons-need-labels-on-mobile-apps) (there a so many more). This is relevant, because, when I started my studies, I was pushing a design that did not label icons:

So looking back, none of that means anything to anyone but me. The challenge is to come up with a short word to describe things like “Paper maps from the archives that have been digitized and georeferenced”, or “a group of points, and/or lines and/or shapes, and/or data for a point and/or area”. Then I read [this](https://medium.com/@supjoey/the-curtain-menu-redesigning-drop-down-navigation-for-mobile-bd63b555a3df#.uli2y7d1s) and then I thought “sweet, I can show labels for a hot minute and then hide them.

So I made:

Better...the product owners liked it. I felt good. It was not a long honeymoon with myself and this iteration. Through my studies and advice/encourgement from my classmates, I had tools and talking points to get time to ask actual humans who would use the platform.

So, I’m almost done burning this whole thing down for...I lost track of the number of times. In theory, I’ve known the importance of prototyping before writing code. Now that I’ve practiced it; I’m a full believer.

Sorry, that was way longer than 2-3 paragraphs. I’ve been wanting to write this up for a while. This ended up being a good start. Anyway, here is the current iteration:
