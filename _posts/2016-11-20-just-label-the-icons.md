>What happens when you layer a science project on top of a walking tour on top of an art experiment on top of an archival map on top of demographic data on top of a memoir? What if the archives of multiple universities and other institutions could be accessed on one platform and layered with the projects, stories, and data from researchers, teachers, students, and community groups?

One thing that happened is the engineer, me, wound up responsible for the design. And now I'm seeking a master's degree in user experience design. I often joke that "I have design opinions, but no design skills." I am not that far into my studies, but I already feel like I'm gaining the missing skills.

1. My design vocabulary has expanded. This makes it easier to ask questions and get answers.
2. I've been inspired by the work my classmates do.
3. I now have a supportive community where I can seek advice...and maybe even give some.

I really meant to talk about a post I read this week on [why you label icons](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/icons-as-part-of-a-great-user-experience/). I've read [plenty](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/) a  [posts](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/15744/do-icons-need-labels-on-mobile-apps) (there a so many more). This is relevant, because, when I started my studies, I was pushing a design that did not label icons:

So looking back, none of that means anything to anyone but me. The challenge is to find up with a short word to describe things like “Paper maps from the archives that have been digitized and georeferenced”, or “a group of points, and/or lines and/or shapes, and/or data for a point and/or area”. Then I read [this](https://medium.com/@supjoey/the-curtain-menu-redesigning-drop-down-navigation-for-mobile-bd63b555a3df#.uli2y7d1s) and this thought “sweet, I can show labels for a hot minute and then hide them.

So I made:

Better...product owners liked it and I felt...okay. However, the more I studied and the more I followed rabbit holes and suggestions from classmates...I’m almost done burning this whole thing down for...I lost track of the number of times. Anyway, here is the current iteration:
