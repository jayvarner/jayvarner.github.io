In this week’s adventures of a software engineer in a user experience design master's program felt more awkward than usual. One presentation introduced me to this concept of “[sprint zero](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=sprint+zero)”. I work on a team that practices agile and I’ve never heard of this. From the way it was presented; I gather that sprint zero describes an initial sprint when design happens in a silo. So, yeah, that does seem to violate the virtues of the agile process. I reject the notion that the agile process is developer centric. The best experience I’ve ever had working on a project was when the designer and I worked together on each user story. We often shared a keyboard where I would write some functional code for a feature and then he would add code to create the corresponding user experience. We were able to quickly produce a really great product. It was a luxury that I am no longer afforded. I miss it so much that I decided to seek an advanced degree in user experience *design*.

The part of this week’s presentation that really bothered was the statement that:

```One thing that we try to stress in the Kent UXD program is that the UX practitioner must be highly collaborative. In practice, that means that you and the product owner, and even members of the development team, would share in the performance of these various activities.```

I would say that every member of the product team must be highly collaborative. The part I take exception to is the snide tone in the recommendation to work with “even members of the development team.” The implication here seems to suggest a tactic of getting chummy with the product owner before the developer enters the picture. I just do not see how that approach can lead to a functional team. I do not see how a dysfunctional team can deliver a quality product.

In my experience developing and delivering software, and in life, it is best to not start off in an adversarial posture. I’m looking forward to expanding on these thoughts in the coming weeks.
