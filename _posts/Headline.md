# Type System:
I went with sans serif fonts. It’s just a personal style thing. I get how they are useful. I just think serifs make things look busy. In life, my personal aesthetic is more modern with clean lines. Though I do get how serifs are useful. That’s why I went with sans font that still have a little flare so you can tell an uppercase “I” from a lowercase “l”.

I went with Merriweather Sans as my primary font. For good reason, this seems to be a popular font. The high x-height of Merriweather Sans makes it very readable on any size screen.

I stuck with Merriweather Sans 

My size range actually follows the fibbernutfuck sequence with a base at 18px. The standard seems to be 16px but I still find myself zooming in on text while looking at my desktop.

I made the subhead all caps because 1) this seems to be a convention and 2) the size is still pretty close to primary size. The caps helps distinguish it.

As this is for web, I did deviate from the font’s standard slacking...DID I STILL

For the pull quote text, I made it the same size as the subhead. However, it’s not make it all caps and the color is lighter. I love pull quotes when I’m skimming an article or going back to find a memorable spot. I hate them when I’m doing a close read. That’s why I made the color lighter and, other than size, I din’t do anything to differente it from the primary text.

For the footnote, I... Again, sticking with the Merriweather Sans because it remains readable at a slightly smaller size. The print world has set up the convention that footnotes are smaller text.




This exercise was great. I dislike some aspects of my blog’s typography. I didn’t really know how to fix it. I’m going to apply my type system and
