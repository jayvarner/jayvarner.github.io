Many things stuck with me this week in my readings for school. One was the cost of drill bits vs. the cost of holes. Drilled holes are very relevant in my life right now as I try to complete a deck on the back of my home. I have a lot to say on the topic. However, the more salient theme throughout the week was the need to give users feedback. Both [Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) and [Johnson](https://archive.org/details/DesigningWithTheMindInMind) directly and indirectly stress this need.

For my assignment to show an example of good design and an example of bad design, I noticed that even the examples I thought were good lacked good and clear feedback, while one candidate for my bad example actually gave pretty good feedback. That was the only thing it did well, but it did it well enough to escape being my poster child for "bad." At the same time, I passed on a few otherwise "good" examples because they lacked good feedback.

I have witnessed how good feedback is key. As a developer, I have debug logs and tools that, while developing and testing, give me tons of feedback. Well, they give me and only me feedback. Then, I watch a user click something that triggers a save. I see it in the logs, but s/he doesn’t see it on the screen. Despite the fact I’ve seen and experienced this frustration,  the feedback feature too often falls off the priority list when trying to meet a development deadline. The readings this week drove home that, as a developer, whenever I write a line to log an event, I should ask myself “Would the user like to know this happened?”
