## Problem
It’s one of the last things a parent wants to hear from their child: “I didn’t have lunch today.” They forgot it. They didn’t have money. There wasn’t an option they liked, or that they could eat. Even a minor disruption in a family’s daily routine can end with a hungry, unfocused child. 


Enter Lunch Money Buddy -- an app that will let parents and caregivers instantly add funds to kids’ accounts and allow them to track the day’s lunch options.

The app includes functions to:  

- Add one or more payment methods.
- Add funds.
- Select a primary payment method.
- Change a payment method.
- Delete a payment method.
- Select whether they’d like balance auto-replenishment or not.
- Turn auto-replenishment on/off.

### User Journeys

I was provided with two personas that represented two distinct audience segments. One was a two-parent family with two kids, Hailee and Brenden. Both parents, Samantha and Jorge, work full time. The other persona, Henry, was retired grandfather with custody of his grandson, Joe.

Using these personas, I mapped out how each would complete a task outlined in the features. An important part of this exercise is thinking about where Henry might be when he is trying to figure out if Joe needs to take a lunch tomorrow, or what else is going on when Samantha gets an alert that Hailee or Brenden has a low balance. This exercise informs everything from navigation to what information is available to when to send alerts.

Understanding the persona families helped me gain empathy for different types of caregivers and the likely schedules of their days. For example, when is it really best to send an alert about the day’s menu, or a low balance? In the evening, when they’re likely at home, in the morning, when they’re busy trying to get out the door, or closer to lunch? It also helped me consider what their levels of technical proficiency might be, and what their privacy concerns might be.

I started by making user journeys. User journeys are a visual that communicates how a person might complete a task. It includes how the person might be feeling and where they might be while accomplishing the task. The user journey helps focus on the goal of a task while reminding us of the fact that the user will not be using the app in a lab, but in the real world where there are competing priorities and emotions. 

### Sitemap

After I had a grasp of the app’s most important function,  it was time to map out the application’s contents.

Creating a site map helped me think through how all the parts, such as the child profile, lunch schedule, lunch descriptions, payment methods, settings, etc., fit  -- or don’t fit -- together. In this stage I started making decisions on labeling and hierarchy. Through the sitemap, the app’s navigation began to emerge. The sitemap was the first real opportunity for stakeholders to get an idea of how the project was developing and to provide feedback.
 
### Wireframes

[![Site Map](/images/lmb-wireframe-sample-small.png)](/images/lmb-wireframe-sample-full.png)

The sitemap provided a starting point to start sketching out how the app will look, work, and flow. This was also an early test of the assumptions I made while making the sitemap. I set out to sketch out each screen.

## Results
Based on the wireframes and feedback from my peers, I built a functional prototype with EmberJS and a simple Rails backed API. The prototype is meant to be a starting point for user testing. While building the prototype, I made many assumptions based on my experience and my connection with the personas. Though the prototype might functionally cover the requested features, it still needs to be tested with actual caregivers of school children.

## Lessons
The most challenging aspect of the design was identifying the central object. As in, when a caregiver goes to the app in a panic, what is the priority? Is it funds, or what is for lunch? Funds seem like the obvious answer. I centered the navigation around adding funds.

Early on, I had to research how programs, like subsidized lunch, before I could include it in my design. In the future, I will identify gaps in my knowledge sooner so I don’t spend too much time spinning my wheels.

Making a wireframe for every screen is a tedious task. It is a great time see opportunities to simplify the interactions. When I got frustrated sketching out each screen, I thought about how a user would be equally frustrated tapping through each screen.

While thinking about the app’s hierarchy, it was really helpful to think about Henry -- the 70 year old retiree with minimal exposure to technology -- who is taking care of his grandson. But as the project went along, it was easy to forget about Henry and revert back to my thinking from my own perspective. In future projects, I plan on making a space to hang the personas on the wall so I will have to look at them everyday.
