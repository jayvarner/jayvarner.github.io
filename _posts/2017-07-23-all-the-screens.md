I have always found wire framing important. As the developer, not the designer, I do them all the time when thinking through new features. No one ever gives me wire frames prior to development.[^why]

However, I have never sat down to wire frame an entire app at once. That is what I ~~did~~ started this week in my user experience design masters program. I realized how valuable this exercise is. I was over it once I was three frames deep in a feature. It really made me ask “do I really need another screen for this function?”

Unfortunately, the answer was often yes...yes I do. I would try one more time to simplify the interaction. Forcing this question to be asked and answered really showed me a sneaky way wire framing has immeasurable value.

[^why]: I am one half of a software engineering team. There is no design team. So design falls on me. Design is my weak area. That is why I am seeking a masters in UXD.
