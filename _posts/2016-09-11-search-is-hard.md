Search is a tricky user experience to design. Advanced search is even harder. If you need advanced search, are you doing it wrong?

Trying to build an advanced search interface is actually what pushed me to into a masters program in user experience design. I found it interesting that, in this week's presentation, the instructor used his experience testing an advanced search interface. To a fault, I might have paid more attention to the narrative and less to the instruction. But the example hit home. For a good year and a half, I have been banging my head on an interface to search thousands of geospatial assets that are confined to a rather small geographic area, Atlanta.
