I have tested with users before. It has always come naturally to me. I had a really hard time with testing papajohns.com for this week's week's assignment. I love that I have friends were willing to help. Yes, friends...it took me a few tries. Here are the handful of reasons I think it was such a slog for me.

1. The first one I did, I was just tired. I had no business conducting a user test at that point. I was totally flat. I knew this, but I had someone lined up and just went ahead. Persumably, in real life, I would schedule a session late on a Friday night.
