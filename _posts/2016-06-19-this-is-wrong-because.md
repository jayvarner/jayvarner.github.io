Throughout my years as a web developer, I was never happy with my attempts at design work. I had great results coding up Photoshop files  from designers, but I could never design something myself that looked right. Something was always off. I often “joke” that I have many design opinions, but no design skills. This week, in my [UXD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) grad program, I was excited to get into some design fundamentals. This week was layouts and grids. Next week is typography. I’m honestly excited about this.

Like I said, whenever I tried to design a page, something would be off. I could just never make that crisp, clean look that I admire in other sites. Through experience, I realized that I lack basic design skills. My spacing was always off. My typography wasn’t consistent. I came to understand the problem, but I didn’t know how to fix it.

In this week’s assignment, we had to give some examples of good and bad design. I really wanted to write about this house in my neighborhood that has two dormers. One is traditional; the other is modern. What architect drew this out, looked at it, and said “that looks good”? I actually sort of hope that the framers just didn’t have enough 2x4s to pitch the second one. They just made it flat and called it good. I didn’t write about it because that’s my critique. It’s not thoughtful. It’s not rooted in any theory. I know I’m right, and I know there has to be a design principle out there to back me up. I just don’t know what that is. For now, all I can say is “this is wrong.” I’m excited to be able to say “this is wrong because...”
