This is the end of my first week as a grad student working on a master’s degree in information architecture with a concentration in user experience design. My biggest struggle this week was reacting to[Tony Faddell’s TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_fadell_the_first_secret_of_design_is_noticing?language=en) and coming up with “something in everyday life that you and other people have become habituated”.

I complain about things all the time. When complaining, my new joke with my spouse is “Can you imagine how insufferable I’m going to be when I have a master’s in this?” My struggle with the question is have I “become habituated” if I still complain about it?

I think the answer is no. So my struggle to come up with an example, despite complaining about everything, pretty much sums up what it is to “become habituated” and the importance of UX design. I’m so habituated, I don’t even realize it.

In hindsight, I should have written about book jackets. They are useless.
