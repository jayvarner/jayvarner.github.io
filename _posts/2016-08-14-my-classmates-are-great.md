This week, what stood out, and has been standing out, is how much I appreciate my classmates. This might seem off topic, but, obviously, I would disagree. Learning how to bounce ideas off classmates is great practice for the professional environment. Even if I end up as a solo practitioner, I would be doing myself and my clients a disservice if I didn't interact and collaborate with the wider UXD community.

The more I apply and research what I am learning to my day job; the more I realize that UXD is far from settled. This makes it really exciting. It also makes it essential to remain engaged in the the wider community.
