*The notion of a golden hammer, "a familiar technology or concept applied obsessively to many software problems", was introduced into information technology literature in 1998 as an anti-pattern: a programming practice to be avoided.*[^yup]

For the past few weeks, I have been building a prototype of an app for my interaction design class. I have been laying out the screens in [Sketch](https://www.switchtosketchapp.com/). This is not new to me. I often use Sketch to, well, sketch out ideas before writing code. I hit a frustrating snag when started trying convert the my sketches into an interactive prototype using [Proto.io](https://proto.io/). For the record, Proto.io was not the problem. It is a very compelling and powerful tool.

I abandoned Proto.io for my three headed golden hammer -- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I’m not going to say it saved me time, but it did make the exercise more comfortable.

I learned an important thing. I should never do this professionally. It was fun to not really care and violate basic best practices in the interest of time and with the attitude or “this is a prototype...it’s not like this is ever going into production.” It would be so easy to say “hey, let’s just get started with this. We’ll fix it before it goes to production.”

It will not get fixed before going to production.

But even for designers, it has to be hard to know these prototypes are throwaways.
